# Project Information
In an effort to learn Perl, I picked up Project Euler and started solving problems. 

## Notable
### EulerUtil.pm
All the relevant utility functions that I had to create. Many of them have been reused, specially array-based representation of numbers and arithmatic on such representation. Others also turned out useful frequently. Do what you will.
